As time goes by you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can you see in your mind's eye 👁
That we are one
We're all the same
And life is just a simple game

In these demon days it's so cold inside 🥶
So hard for a good soul to survive 👻
You can't even trust the air you breathe 💨
'Cause Mother Earth wants us all to leave 🌎🌍🌏
When lies become reality 🤥
Numb yourself with drugs and TV 💉💊📺
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day 😎 
So turn yourself round 🔄
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself 🔥
Turn yourself around into the sun 🌞

"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do
And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor
Go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em
'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music
That's enhanced your lives throughout the years?
Real fucking high on drugs" ːws_damanː

"But when I leave you remember I said, with the last words on my lips,
I am a revolutionary. And you're going to have to keep on saying that. 
You're going to have to say that I am a proletariat. I am the people. 
I'm not the pig. You've got to make a distinction. 
And the people are going to have to attack the pig. 
But when I leave you remember I said, with the last words on my lips, I am a revolutionary."
