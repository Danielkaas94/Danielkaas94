As time goes by you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can you see in your mind's eye
That we are one
We're all the same
And life is just a simple game
🎶

✝❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍✝ 
We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside...
This holy reality, this holy experience
Choosing to be here in...
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion
✝❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍✝







Over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind

Feed my will to feel this moment
Urging me to cross the line
Reaching out to embrace the random
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come
♟


Tell me exactly what am I supposed to do
Now that I have allowed you to beat me
Do you think that we could play another game?
Maybe I can win this time
🥇


So good to be alive and touch
The spirit of freedom
So good to breathe the air and
Feel that life is worth living
There's no time to waste in this life
There's no time at all
⏰


Circle of hands, cold spirits' plan,
Searching my land for an enemy.
Came across love's sweet cost
And in the face of beauty evil was lost.
Sky full of eyes. Minds full of lies.
Black from their cold hearts down to their graves.
Murder the dawn. Spreading their scorn.
Cursing the sun of which love was born.
We must keep them away or pretty soon we'll pay
And count the cost in sorrow.
Sacrifice, the future has its price
And today is only yesterday's tomorrow.

What do you think I am
Do you think I'm dreaming
Don't you know I know
What it is you're scheming


Who d'you think gave you the right
Hidden by the dead of night
To take the world and
Turn it upside down
When it should be round


Seems I made it just in time
To use my reason and my rhyme
To save us from
The evils of your mind


I will cast the spell
Be sure I'll cast it well
I will light a fire
Kindled with desire


I'll fill you with fear
So you know I'm here
And I won't be treated like a fool


It's no good you pretending
There'll be no happy ending
I'm alive and darkness is my tool


But when the night is over
And daytime steals your cover
The goodness of the morning sun
Will warm away
What you have done
And leave you cold


I have no need for moonlight
You're wrong to trust in sunlight
For I exist not just in storms
But in life itself in so many forms
To leave you cold


I will leave you now
But you won't defeat me
You had best beware
When you come to meet me


Love and truth will follow me
An army of reality
Brought from every corner
Of the world


You will never break the spell
I'll summon all the fires of hell
And this is my advice
For what it's worth


Let us not begin
This fight we cannot win
Be sure you're watching me
'Cause all through your life
Everyday and everynight
You should know that
I'll be watching you

Throw down the sword
The fight is done and over
Neither lost, neither won
To cast away the fury of the battle
And turn my weary eyes for home


There were times when I stood at death's own door
Only hoping for an answer


Throw down the sword
And leave the glory
A story time can never change
To walk the road, the load I have to carry
A journey's end, a wounded soul


There were times when I stood at death's own door
Only searching for an answer

🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡⚔🛡








😈👹👿
In these demon days it's so cold inside 🥶
So hard for a good soul to survive 👻
You can't even trust the air you breathe 💨
'Cause Mother Earth wants us all to leave 🌎🌍🌏
When lies become reality 🤥
Numb yourself with drugs and TV 💉💊📺
Pick yourself up it's a brand new day 😎
So turn yourself round 🔄
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself 🔥
Turn yourself around into the sun 🌞
😈👹👿






"See, I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do
And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor
Go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs and burn 'em
'Cause you know what? The musicians who've made all that great music
That's enhanced your lives throughout the years?
Real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high on drugs"

"But when I leave you remember I said, with the last words on my lips,
I am a revolutionary. And you're going to have to keep on saying that.
You're going to have to say that I am a proletariat. I am the people.
I'm not the pig. You've got to make a distinction.
And the people are going to have to attack the pig.
But when I leave you remember I said, with the last words on my lips, I am a revolutionary."


🦆 You souls of geese, That bear the shapes of men 🦆
